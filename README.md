# Machine Learning with TensorFlow
This repository showcases my work on three different machine learning tasks using TensorFlow. Each task is implemented in a separate Jupyter notebook.

# Projects
# 1. Linear Regression on the Titanic Dataset
In this project, I used the Titanic dataset to predict the probability of a person surviving. The model was trained using linear regression, a fundamental algorithm in machine learning.

# 2. Classification on the Iris Dataset
This project involves classifying flowers from the Iris dataset into their respective classes. I used various classification algorithms to train the model and predict the class of a flower based on its features.

# 3. Hidden Markov Model for Weather Prediction
The third project involves predicting weather patterns using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). HMMs are statistical models that are used to predict future states based on current observations. In this project, I used an HMM to predict weather patterns based on historical weather data.

# Installation and Usage
To run these notebooks, you need to have Python and Jupyter installed on your machine. You can install them using Anaconda.

After cloning the repository, navigate to the repositoryâ€™s directory and start Jupyter by running jupyter notebook in your terminal. This will open a new tab in your web browser where you can open and run the notebooks.
